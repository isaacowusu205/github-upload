 Google Cloud Platform Fundemantals: Getting Started with App Engine

 Lab Objectives:

   1. Initialize App Engine

   2. Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.

   3. Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.

   4. Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible.


## Steps
              Task 1: Initialize App Engine
    1. Initialize your App Engine app with your project and choose its region.

        gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID


    2. Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory:

        git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples

    3.  Navigate to the source directory:

        cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world



             Task 2: Run Hello World Application locally
     1. Execute the following command to download and update the packages list.

          sudo apt-get update

     2. A virtual environment is set in which the  application is run.Python virtual environments are used to isolate package installations from the system

        sudo apt-get install virtualenv


        If prompted with [y/n] Press y and enter

    3.    The following code is run next:

        virtualenv -p python3 venv

    4. The virtual environment is activated using the following command

         source venv/bin/activate

    5.  Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies.

         pip install  -r requirements.txt

    6. Run the application:

      python main.py

      Please ignore any warning if any

    7. In Cloud Shell, click Web preview (Web Preview) > Preview on port 8080 to preview the application.

      Result:
       Hello world! is seen on the web package

    8. Press Ctrl+C to end the test


    Task 3: Deploy and Run Hello World on App Engine


    To deploy your application to the App Engine Standard environment:


    1.  Navigate to the source directory type the command:

       cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

    2.Deploy your Hello World application by entering the following command:

       gcloud app deploy

     If prompted with "Do yo want to continue [y/n]" press y and Enter.

     The above  app deploy command uses the app.yaml file to identify project configuration.

     3. Launch your browser to view the app at http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com by using the command:

        gcloud app browse

      4. Copy and paste the URL into a new browser window.

        Result:
         Hello world! is seen in the left side of the web browser

         Task 4: Disabling the application
      1.In the Cloud Console, on the Navigation menu, click App Engine > Settings

      2. Click Disable application.

      3.  Read the dialog message. Enter the App ID and click DISABLE.

        Result: 404 error on the browser page.
